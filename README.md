# WANDER

A Text Adventure Service

## Usage

To really use this you need a game, `Action Castle` is not a complete game, and I will not be updating it to be a complete game because I do not own a license to it. You should, however, buy it and play it with your friends! [Memento Mori Theatrics](http://www.memento-mori.com/). I will be creating a new example game in the next few commits.

To build you'd use the following:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn main start

```

## Development

```bash
$ yarn watch
```
